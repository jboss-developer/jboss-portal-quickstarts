        <h2>JSF2 Hello World Portlet</h2>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates adding ajax processing and updating to a standard JSF component.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the example below, we have a standard JSF inputText with a nested ajax tag. This ajax tag
            triggers an ajax request on every "keyup" event from the input box. The value of the input box is sent
            to the server where the backing bean is updated, and the "output" panelGroup is re-rendered, without
            requiring a full-page refresh.
        </p>
        <p>
            To see this example in action, begin typing in the input box, and watch as your text is echoed with
            html generated from the application server using an ajax call.
        </p>
        <h:form id="jsf2HelloWorldPortlet">
            <h:outputLabel value="Name" for="nameInput"/>
            <h:inputText id="nameInput" value="#{helloBean.name}">
                <f:ajax render="output" event="keyup"/>
            </h:inputText>
            <br />
            
            <p>
                <h:panelGroup id="output">
                    <strong><h:outputText value="Hello #{helloBean.name}!" rendered="#{not empty helloBean.name}"/></strong>
                </h:panelGroup>
            </p>
            
            <h:commandButton id="reset" value="Reset" actionListener="#{helloBean.reset}">
                <f:ajax render="@form" />
            </h:commandButton> - Calls helloBean.reset() on the server side, refreshes the form, but not the whole page.
            <br />
            <h:commandButton id="reload" value="Reload" /> - Reloads the whole page, doesn't reset the string.
            <br />
            
            <h:messages />
        </h:form>
    </h:body>
</f:view>
