gatein-sample-portal: Sample Portal
============================
Author: Thomas Heute, Peter Palaga  
Level: Beginner  
Technologies: GateIn Portal, Portal Container  
Summary: Sample Portal  
Target Product: GateIn  
Source: <https://github.com/gatein/gatein-portal-quickstart>


What is it?
-----------

This project demonstrates a how to create a new Portal Container from scratch. It covers many aspects of new Portal Container
creation, such as:

* Custom Home Page Portlet
* Translation resource bundles
* Pages and Site Layouts
* Navigation Definitions
* Custom Sign In Page

For more details, see [Portal Containers](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/GTNPORTAL36/GDG-Portal+Containers+and+Extensions) page of
GateIn Portal Developer Guide.

System Requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this example project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or newer and Maven 3.0 or newer.

The project is designed to be deployed on GateIn Portal 3.6 running on JBoss AS.

Configure Maven
---------------

You do not need to touch your settings.xml because of this quickstart. All necessary artifacts are available in public
repositories.

Build and Deploy
----------------

Portal Extensions and Portal Containers are not hot-deployable. Therefore, it is not possible to deploy them using 
`mvn jboss-as:deploy` or copying to the default JBoss AS deployment folder when 
GateIn Portal is running. Instead of that you will need to:

1. Make sure that the Portal is not running, e.g. by running 

        $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect controller=127.0.0.1:9999 command=:shutdown

2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Run the following command to build the archive:

        mvn clean package

    This will create `ear/target/gatein-sample-portal.ear`.
4. Copy this file into the GateIn Portal extension deployment folder: `$JBOSS_HOME/gatein/extensions`

Setup JBoss Datasources and Security Policies
---------------------------------------------

In JBoss, Datasources and Security Policies need to be defined on the level of Application Server and they
cannot[*] be defined within EARs because otherwise centralized management would not be possible. This is 
the reason why it is not enough just to deploy `gatein-sample-portal.ear`. You also need to define the 
Datasources and Security Policies e.g. in `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`.

The `standalone.xml` available in the out-of-the-box GateIn Portal 3.6 installation contains the needed pieces
of XML commented out. Please search for `Uncommented this when deploying gatein-sample-portal` in the file and uncomment the
necessary XML code blocks. Note that you should uncomment two `datasource`s and one `security-policy`.

> Except for editting standalone.xml, JBoss Datasources and Security Policies can be defined using CLI or JBoss Web Console as
> described in [JBoss AS 7.1 Admin Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Admin+Guide#AdminGuide-Datasources)

[*] Datasources can be defined in EARs but such ones are not managed, see
[JBoss AS 7.1 Admin Guide](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Admin+Guide#AdminGuide-Deploymentof%5Cds.xmlfiles).


Access the Sample Portal
------------------------

To ensure that the Sample Portal has been deployed successfully visit
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/sample-portal](http://127.0.0.1:8080/sample-portal/)) with your web browser.

Start the Portal
----------------

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

        For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

To delete a Portal Extension or Portal Container:

1. Delete `JBOSS_HOME/gatein/extensions/gatein-sample-portal.ear`
2. Restart GateIn Portal

Please note that the content written to the database by the Extension or Portal Container (such as adding new pages) is not 
reversible.


Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run this Quickstart
------------------------------------------------------------

Portal Extensions and Portal Containers are not directly deployable from JBoss Developer Studio nor Eclipse at this time. 
See Build and Deploy section above for an alternative.

Debug the Application
---------------------

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following 
commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

    mvn dependency:sources
    mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
