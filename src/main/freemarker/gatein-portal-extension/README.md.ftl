What is it?
-----------

This project demonstrates a simple Portal Extension. It shows how it is possible to extend and customize a portal without
modifying the files included in portal.ear. The main advantage of this approach to customization is that upgrades to new
versions of ${compatibility.portal.projectName} will be easier to handle as all the customization can be embedded in separate
deployable packages.

${project.name} customizes the default portal available at [http://localhost:8080/portal](http://localhost:8080/portal) by doing few changes:

* Replace the front page image
* Customize the login page
* Change few translation strings
* Add a few pages

For more details, see [Portal Extension](${portal.devguide.extensions.url}) page of
${compatibility.portal.projectName} Developer Guide.

Access the Extension
--------------------

To ensure that the Portal Extension has been deployed successfully, visit the the base URL of your Portal. Which is
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/portal](http://127.0.0.1:8080/portal/) in the most common case.

You should see some differences compared to the original Portal.
