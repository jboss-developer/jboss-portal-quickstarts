What is it?
-----------

This project demonstrates a how to create a new Portal Container from scratch. It covers many aspects of new Portal Container

Setup JBoss Datasources and Security Policies
---------------------------------------------

In JBoss, Datasources and Security Policies need to be defined on the level of Application Server and they
cannot[*] be defined within EARs because otherwise centralized management would not be possible. This is
the reason why it is not enough just to deploy `${project.artifactId}.ear`. You also need to define the
Datasources and Security Policies e.g. in `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`.

The `standalone.xml` available in the out-of-the-box ${compatibility.portal.projectNameAndVersion} installation contains the needed pieces
of XML commented out. Please search for `Uncommented this when deploying ${project.artifactId}` in the file and uncomment the
necessary XML code blocks. Note that you should uncomment two `datasource`s and one `security-policy`.

> Except for editting standalone.xml, JBoss Datasources and Security Policies can be defined using CLI or JBoss Web Console as
> described in [${compatibility.as.projectNameAndVersion} Admin Guide](${jboss.admin.guide.ds.url})

[*] Datasources can be defined in EARs but such ones are not managed, see
[${compatibility.as.projectNameAndVersion} Admin Guide](${jboss.admin.guide.ds.files.url}).
