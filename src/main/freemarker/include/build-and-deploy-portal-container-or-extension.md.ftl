Build and Deploy
----------------

Portal Extensions and Portal Containers are not hot-deployable. Therefore, it is not possible to deploy them using 
`mvn jboss-as:deploy` or copying to the default ${compatibility.as.name} deployment folder when 
${compatibility.target.productName} is running. Instead of that you will need to:

1. Make sure that the Portal is not running, e.g. by running 

      $JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect controller=127.0.0.1:9999 command=:shutdown

2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Run the following command to build the archive:

      mvn clean package

   This will create `ear/target/${project.artifactId}.ear`.
4. Copy this file into the ${compatibility.target.productName} extension deployment folder: $JBOSS_HOME/gatein/extensions
