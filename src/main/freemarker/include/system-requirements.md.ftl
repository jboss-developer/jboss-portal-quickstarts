System Requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this example project is Java 6.0 (Java SDK 1.6) or newer and Maven 3.0 or newer.

The project is designed to be deployed on GateIn Portal ${compatibility.gatein.version} running on either
JBoss AS or JBoss EAP. There is no support for JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform (EPP) yet, 
but this example projects will evolve to support the upcoming EPP version ${compatibility.epp.version}.
