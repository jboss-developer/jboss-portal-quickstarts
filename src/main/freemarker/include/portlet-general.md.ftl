Build and Deploy the Quickstart
-------------------------------

1. Make sure you have started the Portal as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package jboss-as:deploy

   To deploy to other than default localhost:9999 JBoss instance, copy the following configuration 
   just after `<version>${r"${jboss.as.plugin.version}"}</version>` in the pom.xml file and adjust it to suit your needs.
   `username` and `password` elements can be omitted sometimes, depending on your JBoss security settings.
                 
        <configuration>
            <hostname>127.0.0.1</hostname>
            <port>9999</port>
            <username>admin</username>
            <password>secret</password>
        </configuration>

   This will deploy `target/${project.artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the portal.


Access the deployed Portlet
---------------------------

To ensure that the example portlet has been deployed successfully do the following: 
* Point your web browser at the base URL of your portal (URL of a default local GateIn Portal installation is
[http://127.0.0.1:8080/portal/classic](http://127.0.0.1:8080/portal/classic)).
* Sign in as root or other user with manager:/platform/administrators permissions.
* Go to Top Menu > Group > Administration > Application Registry and hit Import Applications. After that, you should
see the newly imported ${project.name} under the ${project.artifactId} Category.
* Then you can add the example portlet to a page of your choice: either (a) to a new page or (b) to an existing page.
  * If you have chosen (a) to add the portlet to a new page:
    * Go to Top Menu > Group Editor > Add New Page
    * In the Page Creation Wizard, fill in:
      * Node Name: ${project.artifactId}
      * Display Name: ${project.name}
    * Click Next
    * Leave Empty Layout as it is and hit Mext
    * Drag-and-Drop Simplest Hello World Portlet from the Page Editor dialog to the middle of the Page Creation Wizard
    * Click the Diskette-like Finish button in the header of the Page Editor dialog and see the newly added portlet in action.
  * If you have chosen (b) to add the portlet to an existing page:
    * Navigate to the page where you want to add the portlet and go to Top Menu > Group Editor > Edit Page
    * Drag-and-Drop Simplest Hello World Portlet from the Page Editor dialog to a place of your choice within the page.
    * Click the Diskette-like Finish button in the header of the Page Editor dialog and see the newly added portlet in action.


Undeploy the Archive
--------------------

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn jboss-as:undeploy


Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run this Quickstart
------------------------------------------------------------
You can also deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information on how to set up Maven and the JBoss 
tools, refer to the 
[JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 Development Guide](https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/) 
or [Get Started Developing Applications](http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/guide/Introduction/ "Get Started Developing Applications").
