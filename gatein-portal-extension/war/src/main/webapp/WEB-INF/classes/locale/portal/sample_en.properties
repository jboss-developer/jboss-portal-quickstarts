UIHomePagePortlet.Label.ExtendedHomePage=<b>Congratulation</b>, you just installed a new portal extension. A portal extension allows you to customize the default portal by deploying a single archive. In this example we replaced few things: <ul><li>This text</li><li>A couple of translations (The copyright below, the slogan on the image on the left side of this text))</li><li>The <a href="/portal/login">login</a> page</li><li>Additional pages (one for the site 'classic', one for the group 'users', one for the user 'root')</ul>
UIHomePagePortlet.Label.Slogan=My awesome company's website
